# Solarized Theme for Visual Studio

This is my opinionated fork of original Solarized Theme for Visual Studio.

## Changes

*   Supports Resharper plugin
*   Supports VsVim plugins (for VS2008)
*   Supports ViEmu plugin (for VS2010)
*   Uses Envy Code R VS font (preferably modified with low linespacing
    from my github repo [nhq\_fonts](https://github.com/nihique/nhq_fonts))
*   Removed bold characters altogether
*   Italics are used only for comments (using hack from Envy Code R VS,
    as VisualStudio is not able to display italics normally)
*   Various (subjective) usability fixes
