# Solarized Theme for Visual Studio

This is my __opinionated fork of original Solarized Theme for Visual Studio__.

## Themes changed
*   As of today only __solarized-light for VS2008__ is changed.
*   Others will be updated when I or others need them.

## Notes

*   Supports __Resharper__ plugin
*   Supports __VsVim__ plugins (for VS2008)
*   Supports __ViEmu__ plugin (for VS2010)
*   Uses __Envy Code R VS__ font (preferably modified with low linespacing
    from my github repo [nhq\_fonts](https://github.com/nihique/nhq_fonts))
*   __Removed bold characters__ altogether
*   __Italics are used only for comments__ (using hack from Envy Code R VS,
    as VisualStudio is not able to display italics normally)
*   Various (subjective) __usability fixes__
